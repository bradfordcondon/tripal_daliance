Module under development for Biodalliance genome viewer and comparative genome veiwer (synteny).


## Module goals

The ultimate goal for this module is to provide *embedded* genome views.  This would mean a viewer...

* On the organism pane
* For each individual feature, centered on that feature

In addition, it should take advantage of the synteny display.

Before we develop Tripal administration tools, first we want to make sure that this project will be worth implementing.
